                intellectual property rights in the Content you access (including any branding used on or displayed in
                the Service).</p>
            
            <h3>Develop, Improve and Update the Service</h3>
            <p>
                YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual evolution, we may
                make modifications (to all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and
                functionalities, offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones.We may also need to
                alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security
                improvements, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems.
                These changes may affect all users, some users or even an individual user. When the Service requires or
                includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), that software may update
                automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device
                settings. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of the Service, we’ll provide you
                with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to
                legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an
                opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using <a  class="terms-links" href="/t/ google takeout"> Google
                    Takeout,</a> subject to applicable law and policies.</p>
            
            <h2>Your Content and Conduct</h2>
            <h2>Uploading Content</h2>
            <p>
                If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your
                Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not
                submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the
                Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material)
                unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally
                responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your
                Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.</p><br>
            <h3>Rights you Grant</h3>
            <p>You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.
                However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as
                described below.</p>
            <h3>Licence to YouTube</h3>
            <p>
                By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
                transferable, sublicensable licence to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify,
                display and perform it) for the purpose of operating, promoting, and improving the Service.</p>
            
            <h3>Licence to Other Users</h3>
            <p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to access
                your Content through the Service, and to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify,
                display, and perform it) only as enabled by a feature of the Service</p>
            <h3Duration of Licence>
                </h3>
                <p>The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed,
                    the licences will terminate, except where the operation of the Service, use of Content permitted
                    before your removal, or the law requires otherwise. For example, removal of Content by you does not
                    require YouTube to: (a) recall Content that is being used by other users within any limited offline
                    viewing functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for legal
                    purposes </p>
                <h3>Right to Monetize</h3>
                <p>You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may
                    include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does
                    not entitle you to any payments. Starting June 1, 2021, any payments you may be entitled to receive
                    from YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under
                    the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties. If
                    required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments.</p>

                    the option to<a  class="terms-links" href="/t/terms add content">make a copy of your Content</a>before removing it. You

                <h3>Removal of Content By YouTube
                </h3>
                <p>f we reasonably believe that any of your Content (1) is in breach of this Agreement or (2) may cause
                    harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down some or
                    all of such Content. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe
                    that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would
                    otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation
                    or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third
                    party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how

                <h3>Account Suspension and Termination</h3>
                <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. You can also delete the Service from your Google Account,
                    which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data, with the option to download a
                    copy of your data first. </p>

                <p>YouTube reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Google account or your access to all or part
                    of the Service if: (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do
                    so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe that there has

                    Affiliates.

                    (b) would compromise an investigation; (c) would compromise the integrity, operation or security of
                    the Service; or (d) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.</p>
                
                <h3>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</h3>

                    using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement
                    will continue to apply to such use. If you believe that the termination or suspension has been made
                    in error, you can appeal using this form.</p>

                <h3>ownloadable Software</h3>
                <p>When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application),
                    unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a licence, YouTube gives you a
                    personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive licence to use the software
                    provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service. This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling
                    you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by
                    this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the
                    software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws
                    prohibit these restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.</p>
